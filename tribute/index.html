            <h2>A brief summary of Euler's life</h2>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>
                Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707, in Basel, Switzerland, to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the
                Reformed Church, and Marguerite (née Brucker), whose ancestors include a number of well-known scholars
                in the classics. He was the oldest of four children, having two younger sisters, Anna Maria and
                Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich. Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the
                Euler family moved from Basel to the town of Riehen, Switzerland, where his father became pastor in the
                local church and Leonhard spent most of his childhood.
            </p>
            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>
                Johann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, entered into service at the Imperial Russian Academy
                of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in 1725, leaving Euler with the assurance they would recommend him to a
                post when one was available. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than
                a year in Russia. When Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics
                division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend
                Euler. In November 1726, Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint
                Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg in May 1727. He was promoted from his junior post in the
                medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel
                Bernoulli with whom he worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered Russian, settled into life in
                Saint Petersburg and took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy.

            </p>
            <h3>Works :-</h3>
            <h4> Mathematical Notations </h4>
            <p>
                Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely
                circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a function and was the first to
                write <span>f(x) </span> to denote the function f applied to the argument x. He also introduced the
                modern notation
                for the trigonometric functions, the letter e for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as
                Euler's number), the Greek letter <span>Σ</span> for summations and the letter i to denote the imaginary
                unit.
                The use of the Greek letter <span>π</span> to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its
                diameter was also
                popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh mathematician William Jones.
            </p>
            <h4> Analysis </h4>
            <p>
                The development of infinitesimal calculus was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research,
                and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field.
                Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of
                Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his
                reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances. Euler is
                well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series, the expression of functions
                as sums of infinitely many terms, such as

            </p>
            <h4> Number Theory </h4>
            <p>
                Euler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of Christian Goldbach,[73] his friend
                in the St. Petersburg Academy.[56] Much of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the work of
                Pierre de Fermat. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures, such as
                his conjecture that all numbers of the form <span>

                        style="vertical-align: -0.505ex; width:7.184ex; height:2.843ex;" alt="{\textstyle 2^{2^{n}}+1}">
                </span> (Fermat numbers) are prime.

            </p>
            <p>
                Euler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the
                reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta
                function and prime numbers; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.

                An Euler diagram is a diagrammatic means of representing sets and their relationships. Euler diagrams
                consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict sets. Each Euler curve
                divides the plane into two regions or "zones": the interior, which symbolically represents the elements
                of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set. The sizes
                or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The
                spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither)
                corresponds to set-theoretic relationships (intersection, subset, and disjointness). Curves whose
                interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets. Two curves whose interior zones intersect
                represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements
                common to both sets (the intersection of the sets). A curve that is contained completely within the
                interior zone of another represents a subset of it.

            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>
                In St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, Euler was discussing the newly
                discovered planet Uranus and its orbit with Lexell when he collapsed and died from a brain hemorrhage.
